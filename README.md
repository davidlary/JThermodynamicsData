# JThermodynamicsData

A comprehensive Julia package for accessing, processing, and visualizing thermodynamic data from multiple sources with built-in hierarchical selection.

## Overview

JThermodynamicsData provides a unified interface to thermodynamic data for chemical species, combining data from multiple sources with a hierarchical prioritization system. The package implements a rigorously structured hierarchy that automatically selects the most accurate source available for each species based on data quality and reliability.

The system is designed to ensure **complete replacement** of data from lower priority sources with higher priority sources, guaranteeing that the final result exactly matches the highest priority source available for each species.

## Key Features

- **Multi-source data access**: Access thermodynamic data from 14 different sources, including:
  - Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT)
  - Burcat Database
  - NIST Chemistry WebBook
  - NIST ThermoData Engine (TDE)
  - JANAF Thermochemical Tables
  - NASA Chemical Equilibrium with Applications (CEA)
  - And more...

- **Hierarchical selection**: Automatically selects the highest quality data source available for each species.

- **Data visualization**: Generate comparative plots of thermodynamic properties across multiple sources.

- **Database integration**: Store and query thermodynamic data using DuckDB.

- **Comprehensive validation**: Ensure proper hierarchy respect and data accuracy.

## Data Hierarchy

The package implements a strict hierarchy of data sources based on their accuracy and reliability:

| Priority | Source | Reliability | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 13 | atct | 5.0 | Active Thermochemical Tables (highest accuracy) |
| 12 | burcat | 4.9 | Burcat Database (very high accuracy) |
| 11 | nist-webbook | 4.95 | NIST Chemistry WebBook (high accuracy) |
| 10 | tde | 4.8 | NIST ThermoData Engine (high accuracy) |
| 9 | thermoml | 4.5 | ThermoML Standard (good accuracy) |
| 8 | janaf | 4.5 | JANAF Thermochemical Tables (good accuracy) |
| 7 | nasa-cea | 4.0 | NASA CEA Database (decent accuracy) |
| 6 | chemkin | 3.8 | CHEMKIN format data (decent accuracy) |
| 5 | gri-mech | 3.5 | GRI-MECH 3.0 (decent accuracy) |
| 4 | quantum-statistical | 4.0 | Quantum-Statistical calculations (best theoretical) |
| 3 | benson-group | 3.0 | Benson Group Additivity (good theoretical) |
| 2 | stat-thermo | 3.5 | Statistical thermodynamics (moderate theoretical) |
| 1 | group-contribution | 3.0 | Group contribution methods (basic theoretical) |
| 0 | theoretical | 2.5 | Basic theoretical calculations (lowest accuracy) |

**IMPORTANT**: Experimental sources (ATcT through GRI-MECH) are prioritized over theoretical sources when available. The system ensures that the highest quality source is always used for each species.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/JThermodynamicsData.git
   cd JThermodynamicsData
   ```

2. Set up the environment and install all required packages:
   ```bash
   julia scripts/setup_packages.jl
   ```

3. Run the complete workflow script:
   ```bash
   julia run_complete_workflow.jl
   ```

The complete workflow script handles:
1. Downloading all data sources
2. Processing data into JSON files
3. Syncing data to DuckDB database
4. Generating comparison plots
5. Validating the hierarchy selection

## Workflow

The new consolidated workflow simplifies the thermodynamic data processing:

```bash
# Run the complete workflow (download, process, database, plots, validation)
julia run_complete_workflow.jl
```

This single command replaces the previous multi-step process:
```bash
# Old workflow (no longer needed)
# julia scripts/download_all_sources.jl
# julia scripts/fetch_all_sources.jl
# julia run_all_species_plots.jl
# julia scripts/sync_json_to_database.jl
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Clear compiled code:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.julia/compiled/v1.*/JThermodynamicsData
   ```

2. Reinitialize the database:
   ```bash
   rm -f ~/Dropbox/Environments/Code/JThermodynamicsData/data/thermodynamics.duckdb
   ```

3. Run the complete workflow again:
   ```bash
   julia run_complete_workflow.jl
   ```

## Hierarchical Thermodynamic Data Sources

JThermodynamicsData implements a comprehensive hierarchical approach to thermodynamic data processing. The system ensures that for each species, the most accurate available source is used, following these principles:

1. **Full Hierarchical Traversal**: The system always processes all sources in order of increasing priority.
2. **Complete Replacement**: Higher priority sources completely replace data from lower priority sources (no weighted averaging).
3. **Most Accurate Source**: The final refined result is exactly the value from the most accurate source available (highest priority).
4. **Theoretical Source Display**: Plots show only ONE theoretical source (best available) labeled consistently as "Theoretical".
5. **Consistent Source Naming**: All sources in plots are displayed with proper capitalization.
6. **Documentation**: All data sources used for each species are thoroughly documented, including which source was selected as the most accurate.

### Theoretical vs. Experimental Sources

The package provides both theoretical calculations and experimental data:

- **Theoretical Methods** (Priority 0-4)
  - Basic theoretical calculations
  - Group contribution methods
  - Statistical thermodynamics
  - Benson Group Additivity
  - Quantum-Statistical Thermodynamics

- **Experimental Databases** (Priority 5-13)
  - GRI-MECH 3.0
  - CHEMKIN format data
  - NASA CEA Database
  - JANAF Thermochemical Tables
  - ThermoML Standard
  - NIST ThermoData Engine
  - NIST Chemistry WebBook
  - Burcat Database
  - Active Thermochemical Tables

The hierarchical system automatically uses experimental data when available, falling back to theoretical calculations only when necessary. For ALL species (including ions like OH-, NO+, NO2+, Zn), the system ensures proper hierarchical traversal.

## Output

The package produces several outputs:

- **Plots**: Saved in `plots/` directory - Shows all available sources with the best one highlighted
- **Data tables**: Saved in `output/tables/` directory - Contains numerical data for all properties
- **Source documentation**: Saved in `output/docs/` directory - Documents sources used for each species
- **Summary report**: Saved to `output/summary_report.md` - Overview of all processed species
- **Database**: Saved to `data/thermodynamics.duckdb` - For efficient querying

## Basic Usage

```julia
using JThermodynamicsData

# Run the complete workflow
include("run_complete_workflow.jl")

# Calculate thermodynamic properties for a species
properties = JThermodynamicsData.calculate_properties("H2O", 298.15)
println("Cp of H2O at 298.15 K: $(properties.cp) J/molÂ·K")
println("Source used: $(properties.source)")

# See all available sources for a species
sources = JThermodynamicsData.list_available_sources("O3")
println("Available sources for O3:")
for (source, priority, reliability) in sources
    println("  $source (priority: $priority, reliability: $reliability)")
end
```

## Storage Systems

JThermodynamicsData now uses a combined approach:

1. **JSON Storage**: Each species has a JSON file in `data/species/` containing data from all sources
2. **Database Storage**: Data is synced to DuckDB for efficient querying

This combined approach provides both human-readable storage and efficient query capabilities.
