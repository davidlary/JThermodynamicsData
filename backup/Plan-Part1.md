Plan for JThermodynamics Database with Enhanced Features

  1. Data Acquisition & Caching
    - Implement automatic fetching from online sources with fallback to local copies
    - Create structured local cache with versioning for each database
    - Add logging/checksums to track data freshness
  2. Database Schema Design
    - Develop a flexible DuckDB schema that accommodates all formats
    - Include metadata fields for provenance, quality metrics, uncertainty
    - Implement efficient indexing for species-based queries
  3. Data Processing Pipeline
    - Create format-specific parsers for each database type
    - Implement polynomial/tabular data converters for consistent representation
    - Add validation routines to detect anomalies or inconsistencies
  4. Hierarchical Query System
    - Implement query engine that follows the specified hierarchy
    - Include temperature range checking to select appropriate data
    - Provide confidence scoring based on data source reputation
  5. Quality & Validation
    - Add cross-validation between data sources with statistical metrics
    - Implement uncertainty propagation where available
    - Create visualization tools for comparing thermodynamic properties
  6. Theoretical Fallback System
    - Implement statistical thermodynamics calculations using molecular parameters
    - Incorporate group contribution methods for organic species
    - Add machine learning models trained on existing database data
    - Interface with quantum chemistry packages for ab initio calculations
  7. Uncertainty Quantification
    - Leverage Julia's Measurements.jl for consistent uncertainty propagation
    - Implement Monte Carlo approaches for complex uncertainty cases
    - Provide uncertainty metrics for all thermodynamic properties at each temperature
    - Create confidence interval visualizations across temperature ranges
  8. Performance Optimization
    - Precompute common thermodynamic properties across temperature ranges
    - Cache frequently accessed species data
    - Implement parallel processing for batch calculations
  9. API & Integration
    - Create flexible query API for accessing the thermodynamic data
    - Include export functions for common simulation formats
    - Provide hooks for integration with other Julia packages

  This comprehensive plan ensures we always return data with appropriate uncertainty quantification, even when relying on
  theoretical calculations as a last resort.
