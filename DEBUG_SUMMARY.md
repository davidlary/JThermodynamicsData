# Debugging Summary for JThermodynamicsData

This document summarizes the issues identified and fixes applied to make the JThermodynamicsData package work correctly.

## Identified Issues

1. **Constant name inconsistency:**
   - The statistical_thermodynamics.jl file was using lowercase constants (`h`, `kb`, `na`, `c`) but only the uppercase versions (`H`, `KB`, `NA`, `C`) were defined in constants.jl
   - Fix: Added lowercase aliases in statistical_thermodynamics.jl and also in run_thermodynamics.jl

2. **Type conversion issues:**
   - Functions were not properly handling different numeric types (Integer vs Float)
   - Fix: Ensured consistent type conversion to Float64 for all temperature values and other numeric parameters

3. **Keyword argument handling bugs:**
   - Several functions had issues with how keyword arguments were defined and passed
   - Fix: Modified function signatures and calls to properly handle keyword arguments

4. **Missing data handling:**
   - The code didn't properly handle cases where data was missing from the database
   - Fix: Added proper error handling and fallback to theoretical calculations

5. **Method not found errors:**
   - Functions in utility modules like get_from_cache had method errors
   - Fix: Ensured that functions work with the appropriate types and have fallbacks

## Key Components Fixed

1. **run_thermodynamics.jl:**
   - Added lowercase constant aliases
   - Created fixed calculate_properties function that properly handles keyword args
   - Added better error handling and fallbacks to direct calculations
   - Fixed type stability issues

2. **direct_n2_calculator.jl:**
   - Created a standalone N2 calculator that doesn't depend on database
   - Used NASA-7 polynomial coefficients from GRI-Mech 3.0
   - Made it work across the entire temperature range

3. **run_with_n2.jl:**
   - Created a direct testing script that avoids issues with include() and scope
   - Implemented the direct N2 calculator inline to avoid dependencies
   - Successfully generated plots and output data

## Remaining Work

1. **Cache function issues:**
   - The get_from_cache and store_in_cache functions still have method errors
   - Need to check if the database schema includes the necessary cache tables

2. **Progressively_refine_thermodynamic_data function:**
   - This function may need further fixes related to error handling

3. **Test with more species:**
   - Once N2 is working correctly, test with additional species

## Lessons Learned

1. **Type stability is crucial in Julia:**
   - Always ensure proper type conversions, especially for numerical values
   - Use parametric types like `<:Real` for more flexible function signatures

2. **Keyword arguments require careful handling:**
   - In Julia, there's a distinction between positional and keyword arguments
   - When passing keyword args to another function, syntax matters (with or without semicolon)
   - When refactoring, consider changing keyword args to positional args if they cause issues

3. **Fallback implementations are valuable:**
   - Having a direct implementation (like the N2 calculator) provides a reference
   - Can be used when more complex methods fail

4. **Proper error handling is essential:**
   - Use try-catch blocks when working with database or complex calculations
   - Provide informative error messages and warnings

5. **Constants should be consistently named:**
   - Prefer consistent naming conventions (all uppercase or all lowercase)
   - If mixing cases, ensure proper aliases exist
